## Overview

Elekta is a forward-thinking Swedish healthcare company that provides precision radiation therapy solutions. They asked Fifth Dimension to improve their current intranet solution, Elekta.biz. The previous solution relied on obsolete technology, which hampered editorial efficiency. The upgrade would need to significantly improve the user experience and site speeds for over 3,000 employees.
Our solution needed to be more flexible, reduce operational costs, reduce publishing delays, and provide faster search results.

## My responsibilities

-   The designs and static templates were hosted in a secure listing to keep stakeholders informed throughout the development process. <span class="label label--info !m-0">Project management</span>
-   I designed the visual layouts in Photoshop and oversaw any revisions to ensure the client was satisfied with the proposed solution.
-   I created all of the Front-End HTML templates. These were then handed over to a team of back-end developers, complete with detailed annotations, listing indexes, and support documentation.
-   I assisted in configuring the content management system (EPiServer) and oversaw the testing of the transferred site content throughout the development process. <span class="label label--info !m-0">collaboration</span>

## Final comments

Fifth Dimension's upgrade resulted in a **67% increase** in site usage, a **90% decrease** in pages viewed during a search, and a **51% reduction** in the time it takes users to find target documents.

The client was very pleased with the improved performance, aesthetics, and user experience that we achieved with the upgrade.

> Just wanted to drop you a line to say how amazing the new portal looks and acts. So many over here are more than impressed with the design, the ease of use and how much different their experience is with this, than with the previous site. So congratulations on all the hard work you put in to making this site a roaring success.

These images have been captured from static templates, but they accurately represent the site that was launched. Fifth dimension (the agency) reformed as K Wearables, a start-up focused on launching the worldâ€™s first contactless payment ring, [K Ring](/work/mykring), and this site has since been relinquished.
